# covid4eu-sorbonne
COVID4EU+ is an international program, proposed by Sorbonne University - Paris, France, in collaboration with many other universities in Europe, during the second semester of 2020. The course is entirely English, it equips students with the knowledge to understand the Covid pandemic in all dimensions: better understanding the concept of “model”, manipulating the data, acting in autonomy, exercising our critical thinking, and countering fake news. Our team had chosen to work on the Economy: “Analysis of Labor Market decisions of men and women during the COVID-19 pandemic in the 4EU+ countries.”. In the following section, I will upload our work, including the Data Engineering part, the Analytical and Visualization part.
