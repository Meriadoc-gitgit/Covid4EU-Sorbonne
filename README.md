# Introduction
**COVID4EU+** is an international program, *proposed by Sorbonne University - Paris, France, in collaboration with many other universities in Europe, since the second semester of 2020.* The course is entirely English, it equips students with the knowledge to understand the Covid pandemic in all dimensions: better understanding the concept of “model”, manipulating the data, acting in autonomy, exercising our critical thinking, and countering fake news. </br>
Our team had chosen to work on the **Economy: “Analysis of Labor Market decisions of men and women during the COVID-19 pandemic in the 4EU+ countries”.** And in the following section, I will upload our work, including the Data Engineering part, the Analytical and the Visualization part. </br> </br>
