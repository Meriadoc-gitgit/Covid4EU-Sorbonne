# Introduction
**COVID4EU+** is an international program, *proposed by Sorbonne University - Paris, France, in collaboration with many other universities in Europe, since the second semester of 2020.* The course is entirely English, it equips students with the knowledge to understand the Covid pandemic in all dimensions: better understanding the concept of “model”, manipulating the data, acting in autonomy, exercising our critical thinking, and countering fake news. </br>
Our team had chosen to work on the **Economy: “Analysis of Labor Market decisions of men and women during the COVID-19 pandemic in the 4EU+ countries”.** </br>
We have used several tools to handle and process data. In addition to NumPy and Matplotlib (which were introduced in the course), we used Pandas to read and filter datasets. Pandas enables to create data frames from .csv files and provides a simple interface to get statistics about rows and columns, filter data points and perform data cleaning. We also used RStudio to simplify the data engineer task, then export the data from .xlsx file to .csv file. </>
To make sure that the analysis process works out smoothly, we have to build many different datasets extracted from the main one, which contains all information needed from the twenty-seven countries selected; each one is constructed based on gender (men or women) and labor status (employed or unemployed). We analyze the data collected based on the Macroeconomic Theory.
And in the following section, I will upload our work, including the Data Engineering part, the Analytical and the Visualization part. </br> </br>
